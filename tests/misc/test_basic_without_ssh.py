# These tests are basic tests meant to be run to check that a VM performs
# well, without obvious issues.
# However, it does not go beyond checking that basic operations work,
# because the VM may not have SSH installed, which is needed for more advanced scenarios.
#
# Requirements:
# - a two-host XCP-ng pool >= 8.1.
# - the pool must have 1 shared SR
# - each host must have a local SR
# - any VM with guest tools installed. No SSH required for this test suite.
# - when using an existing VM, the VM can be on any host of the pool,
#   the local SR or shared SR: the test will adapt itself.
#   Note however that an existing VM will be left on a different SR after the tests.
#
# This test suite is meant to be run entirely. There's no guarantee that cherry-picking tests will work.
