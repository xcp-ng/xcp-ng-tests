# Due to a bug in the way pytest handles the setup and teardown of package-scoped fixtures,
# we moved the following fixtures out of the main conftest.py.
# To workaround the bug, the fixture must be imported either in a package's own conftest.py,
# or directly in a test module. Then the fixtures will truly be handled as package-scoped.
